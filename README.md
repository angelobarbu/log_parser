# Python Log Parser
## Barbu Angelo-Gabriel - angelo.barbu123@gmail.com

Python script that extracts the log lines from multiple .log file compressed in a .zip and processes them in a dataframe.
**Regex** was used for multiple timestamp identification and **pandas** for storing a big chunk of log data. The log data
is then sorted ascending and parsed into a .csv format.
